# _Pizza Parlor, Independent Project Week 4_

#### _Pizza Order Form, August 26th 2016_

#### By _Amber Farrington_

## Description

_This project is to demonstrate my skills in Javascript Object Oriented programming by making a custom pizza generator. The user enters their name, chooses their pizza toppings, and the size of the pizza. The program then generates a price based on the options and displays it for the user._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Go to www.github.com/NWShadowDev/PizzaOrder_

## Behavior Driven Development (AKA: BDD)

_Behavior 1) User accesses the site_

_Behavior 2) User enters their name (Note: You do NOT have to hit a submit button for the program to save your name)_

_Behavior 3) User selects their pizza toppings using a checkbox form (multi-select does work, but not all the values are stored - See Known Bugs)_

_Behavior 4) User selects the size of the pizza they want via a select form_

_Behavior 5) User hits the "Submit Order" button_

_Behavior 6) User can view their price total for the order after submit_

_Behavior 7) User must refresh the page to start again_


## Known Bugs

_Function to see if order form is empty is commented out for further testing_
_Multiple selection for toppings is allowed, but not all values are taken into the formula, just one_
